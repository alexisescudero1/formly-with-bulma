# Formly with Bulma CSS

## What's this?

It's a angular 9 project with an example reactive form using [Formly](https://formly.dev/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

## Why?

By default formly supports the next ui-themes
* bootstrap
* material
* ionic
* primeng
* kendo
* nativescript

So, I made this implementation of custom inputs and wrappers using Bulma as the ui-theme for Formly

## Where can I see it in action?

It's hosted on github pages [here](http://alexisescudero1.github.io/formly-with-bulma/).

### Pending
Add support to:
* Radio Buttons
* Checkboxes
* Responsive
